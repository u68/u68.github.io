<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I am a self-taught programmer and an experienced musician.
    I have been working with computers for over 4 years now.
    My Github profile is <a href="https://github.com/u68">@u68</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>For the past two years I have been focusing on embedded systems and have written several programs for heavily underpowered systems designed to run at high speeds, high efficiency and ultra low power consumption.
    I have joined several programming communities such as <a href="https://github.com/fxesdev">fxesdev</a>, a group dedicated to reverse engineering calculators and making projects related to them.</p>
<hr>
<p>My best projects are here:</p>
<h2 id="-tangent-https-github-com-u68-tangent-"><a href="https://github.com/u68/tangent">Tangent</a></h2>
<p>Tangent is an operating system / kernel designed for single core embedded systems where arbitrary code execution is impossible, and makes use of emulation to run custom assembly - like programs, it features a virtual machine, kernel, desktop and assembler with a prebuilt rom for demonstration purposes.
    It is made for a c89 or above compiler to be as compatible as possible, but it was specifically designed for the NX-U8/100 core like most of my projects.</p>
<h2 id="-hex-editor-https-github-com-u68-hex-editor-"><a href="https://github.com/u68/hex-editor">Hex Editor</a></h2>
<p>As the name suggests, this is a very simple and fast / efficient hex editor targeted towards embedded systems, at the time it was used to document an unknown microcontroller and had a built in benchmark (sand simulation) to test the current speed. </p>
<h2 id="-cwii-fck-https-github-com-fxesdev-cwii-fck-"><a href="https://github.com/fxesdev/cwii-fck">CWII-Fck</a></h2>
<p>CWII-Fck is a port of a programming language called &quot;brainfuck&quot; where there are only 8 symbols used: &lt; &gt; , . [ ] + -, it is designed to be as un-readable and confusing as possible.</p>
<h2 id="-minesweeper-https-github-com-fxesdev-minesweeper-"><a href="https://github.com/fxesdev/minesweeper">Minesweeper</a></h2>
<p>This is a remake of the famous computer game called Minesweeper, where the aim is to dig out every cell in the board without digging up a mine.</p>
<h2 id="-2048-https-github-com-fxesdev-2048-"><a href="https://github.com/fxesdev/2048">2048</a></h2>
<p>This is a remake of the famous mobile phone game called 2048, where you merge tiles on a 4x4 board to get the tile, 2048 (winning the game).</p>
