# About Me
I am a self-taught programmer and an experienced musician.
I have been working with computers for over 4 years now.
My Github profile is [@u68](https://github.com/u68).

---
For the past two years I have been focusing on embedded systems and have written several programs for heavily underpowered systems designed to run at high speeds, high efficiency and ultra low power consumption.
I have joined several programming communities such as [fxesdev](https://github.com/fxesdev), a group dedicated to reverse engineering calculators and making projects related to them.

My best projects are here:

## [Tangent](https://github.com/u68/tangent)
Tangent is an operating system / kernel designed for single core embedded systems where arbitrary code execution is impossible, and makes use of emulation to run custom assembly - like programs, it features a virtual machine, kernel, desktop and assembler with a prebuilt rom for demonstration purposes.
It is made for a c89 or above compiler to be as compatible as possible, but it was specifically designed for the NX-U8/100 core like most of my projects.

## [Hex Editor](https://github.com/u68/hex-editor)
As the name suggests, this is a very simple and fast / efficient hex editor targeted towards embedded systems, at the time it was used to document an unknown microcontroller and had a built in benchmark (sand simulation) to test the current speed. 

## [CWII-Fck](https://github.com/fxesdev/cwii-fck)
CWII-Fck is a port of a programming language called "brainfuck" where there are only 8 symbols used: < > , . [ ] + -, it is designed to be as un-readable and confusing as possible.


## [Minesweeper](https://github.com/fxesdev/minesweeper)
This is a remake of the famous computer game called Minesweeper, where the aim is to dig out every cell in the board without digging up a mine.


## [2048](https://github.com/fxesdev/2048)
This is a remake of the famous mobile phone game called 2048, where you merge tiles on a 4x4 board to get the tile, 2048 (winning the game).
